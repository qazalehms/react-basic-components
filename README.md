# Exploratory XR Prototype for Adaptive Guidance

This repository contains a very simple, exploratory web-based AR prototype created as part of an early investigation into how extended reality (XR) can support human-centred interaction design.

## Purpose
The prototype explores the idea of lightweight, non-intrusive AR overlays that provide short guidance or motivational cues during moments of hesitation. It is intentionally minimal and conceptual, focusing on interaction ideas rather than technical complexity.

## Tools
- A-Frame
- AR.js
- Web-based AR (mobile browser)

## How it works
Scan the Hiro marker using a mobile device with camera access. A basic AR overlay (text and box) appears, representing an adaptive guidance cue.

## Context
This prototype was developed as an initial exploration for the Moodspire project, an adaptive HCI concept focused on emotional guidance, digital well-being, and meaningful activity selection.

## Status
Exploratory prototype – not a production-level implementation.
